# Archives

A curated vault of my old projects, experiments, practice code, and anything else that deserves a quiet retirement but still deserves to exist. This repository keeps my past work organized, preserved, and accessible — without cluttering my active repos.

## Purpose

This repo exists as a long-term storage space for codebases and projects I’m no longer actively developing but still want to reference for:

* Past implementations
* Code evolution and improvement
* Backup of school and personal projects
* Experiments and prototypes

It’s basically the attic, but without the dust.

## Structure

Each archived project lives in its own folder:

```
Archives/
  ├── CSharp/        # Imported from its own repo, full history preserved
  ├── Java/
  └── ...
```

## How Projects Are Added

Projects are imported with full Git history when possible, so the timeline of commits stays intact. This makes it easier to look back at how each project evolved.

## Why Keep an Archives Repo?

Because progress matters. Every file here represents a phase in my learning journey. Instead of deleting old work or letting it rot in abandoned repos, everything gets consolidated into one well-organized home.

## Cloning

```
git clone https://github.com/Wacky-sama/Archives.git
```
