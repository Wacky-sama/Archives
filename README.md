# Archives

A curated vault of my old projects, experiments, practice code, and anything else that deserves a quiet retirement but still deserves to exist. This repository keeps my past work organized, preserved, and accessible — without cluttering my active repos.

## Purpose

This repo exists as a long-term storage space for codebases and projects I’m no longer actively developing but still want to reference for:

* Past implementations
* Code evolution and improvement
* Backup of school and personal projects
* Experiments and prototypes

It’s basically the attic, but without the dust.
